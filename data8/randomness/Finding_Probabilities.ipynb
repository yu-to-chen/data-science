    "# Finding Probabilities\n",
    "Over the centuries, there has been considerable philosophical debate about what probabilities are. Some people think that probabilities are relative frequencies; others think they are long run relative frequencies; still others think that probabilities are a subjective measure of their own personal degree of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, most probabilities will be relative frequencies, though many will have subjective interpretations. Regardless, the ways in which probabilities are calculated and combined are consistent across the different interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, probabilities are numbers between 0 and 1, or, equivalently, 0% and 100%. Impossible events have probability 0. Events that are certain have probability 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Math is the main tool for finding probabilities exactly, though computers are useful for this purpose too. Simulation can provide excellent approximations, with high probability. In this section, we will informally develop a few simple rules that govern the calculation of probabilities. In subsequent sections we will return to simulations to approximate probabilities of complex events.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the standard notation $P(\\mbox{event})$ to denote the probability that \"event\" happens, and we will use the words \"chance\" and \"probability\" interchangeably."
